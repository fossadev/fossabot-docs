# Keywords

Keywords allow you to define how Fossabot should respond based on the contents of a message, username, or both.

You define these conditions through the use of `phrase groups`, and when all phrases within a given phrase group are matched, Fossabot will execute the keyword response.

These are particularly useful for things such as moderation, or responding to frequently asked questions in chat.

All variables are available on keyword responses.
