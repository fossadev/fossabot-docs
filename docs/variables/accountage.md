# $(accountage)

Allows you to view how long a Twitch account has been registered

This variable has one **optional** parameter where you can enter someone's username to fetch the accountage for, for example `$(accountage fossabot)`. Otherwise it defaults to finding the accountage of whoever sent that message.

```
Fossabot created their account 3 years, 6 months, 5 days and 3 hours ago 
```
