# $(countup)

Returns the time that has passed since a specified date.

:::info This variables shares the same behavior with $(countdown)!

Both `$(countup)` and `$(countdown)` work the exact same way and only coexist for syntactic sugar.

If you provide a date **in the past**, they both will return the time that **has passed** since then, but if you provide a date **in the future** instead, they will both return the time that **is left** until then.

:::

#### Parameters
