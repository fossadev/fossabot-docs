Returns the current Fossabot shard uptime that handled this message.

:::info

Fossabot is a distributed bot that is made up of many microservices, and runs across multiple servers/processes.

This means that the uptime of your bot may be completely different to another channel, it may randomly reset if the system decides it needs to move you to a new server etc. It is not indicative of any platform instability, Fossabot is built to withstand large scale, full server failures.
