Returns a decoded version of a URL encoded string.

:::info The parsing for how queries are escaped/unescaped is often dependent on the programming language.

Fossabot is written in Go and uses the native query encoder/decoders. Please refer to the [**Go documentation**](https://pkg.go.dev/net/url#QueryEscape) if you come across any inconsistencies.

:::

#### Parameters

This variable takes ***one*** *required* parameter that is an encoded string that is supposed to be decoded.

#### Example Output

    ```
    my example string
    ```
