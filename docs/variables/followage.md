# $(followage)

Allows you to view how someone has followed a given Twitch channel.

This variable has two **optional** parameters where you can enter the followe and the channel to see how long said followee has been following for, for example $(followage fossabot wipz). Otherwise it defaults to either the username and the current channel or the first and second arguments.

```
fossabot has been following wipz for: 1305d, 22h, 29m and 45s.
```
