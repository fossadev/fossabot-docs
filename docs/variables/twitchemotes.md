# $(twitchemotes)

Returns all subscriber emotes available in a channel.

This variable has one optional argument, you may pass a channel login to fetch another channels' emotes, for example, `$(twitchemotes aiden)` would fetch all of `aiden`'s emotes.

If no arguments are passed (`$(twitchemotes)`), it will default to the broadcasters' channel.
