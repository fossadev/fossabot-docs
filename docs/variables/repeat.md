# $(repeat)

Repeats something you specify in arguments an arbitrary amount of times, with spaces in-between.

Two arguments are required, the syntax is `$(repeat <amount> <content>)`, therefore:

```
$(repeat 5 PogChamp Kappa)
```

would produce:

```
PogChamp Kappa PogChamp Kappa PogChamp Kappa PogChamp Kappa PogChamp Kappa
```
